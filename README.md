# Ubuntu 20.04 Toolchain

This is a small repository with a Dockerfile to build an Ubuntu 20.04 container with the necessary tools to build and run C/C++ code.

## Version control

We intend to use [semantic versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) to keep track of new versions of this repository. Right now, we will limit ourselves to a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format and not use additional labels because we have a bash script that validates the version number and bash does not support PCRE regex. We might change this in the future.

Please document any official changes in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file. We are trying to follow the recommendations in [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) on how to write it.
